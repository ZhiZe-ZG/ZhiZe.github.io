This collection contains introductions and study guides for many languages. The collection content is organized into languages. The introduction to each language includes pronunciation, writing system, grammar, vocabulary, logic, rhetoric, etc.

The classification and relationships of languages refer to ISO 639. Use ISO 639-3 codes as language identifiers. But the writing order of content is guided by my personal interests. My main goal was not to study obscure languages, so most of the languages presented were chosen from the [ISO 639-1 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).
