## Introduction

Font file format, which belongs to the OpenType font file format. But OpenType defines two specific formats, and this is one of them. It's related to Adobe's PostScript.

This format has various suffixes, but I generally use `.otf` as the suffix. There is also a way of using `.otc` to represent a collection of such font formats, but treating `.otc` as another file format.

Besides, `.otf` can also be used as a suffix for TrueType-flavored fonts.
