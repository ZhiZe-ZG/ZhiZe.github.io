## Introduction

Bash is a classic Linux shell, but it is old and some designs of it are no longer meet modern needs. Although it is set as the default shell by many distributions, in actual use there are many other options.

GNU Bash is generally started through the `bash` command, but it also provides a `sh` command, which is started in a manner compatible with `sh` on Unix to ensure accurate execution of scripts. You can use `pacman -F /usr/bin/sh` on Arch Linux to view the package to which `sh` belongs.

Due to the lack of more information about the `sh` command on Arch (and we cannot presume that it is the Bourne Shell complied from the original codes), it will not be introduced as a standalone software.
