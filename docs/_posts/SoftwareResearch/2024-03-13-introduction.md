This is the introduction to the series articles "Software Research". This series introduces basic information about the software that I am concerned about.

## Symbols and Tags

Here are descriptions of the symbols I'll use in the articles:

* Openness
  * Open Source?
    * 📖 Open Source
    * 📕 Close Source
  * Charge?
    * 🆓 Free
    * 💰 Charge
* System
  * Developer System
    * 🪟 Windows
    * 🍎 MacOS
    * 🐧 Linux-bsed
    * 😈 BSD-based
  * Consumer System
    * 🍏 Apple consumer systems (iOS, iPadOS etc.)
    * 🤖 Android-based consumer systems

Here are some tags I would label these articles:

* Basic Interface
  * CLI: Command Line Interface. Mainly interact with text commands. Can be run in a virtual terminal, but may also be run in other ways such as voice interaction. After all, text commands are abstract and can be used in various carrier.
  * TUI: Text-based User Interface. An interface with a graphical layout rendered in a terminal.
  * GUI: Graphical User Interface. A true flat graphical interface, with keyboard and pointing device as the main control method.
  * TouchGUI: Graphical User Interface. Finger touch is the main mode of operation.

In addition, I will add at least one tag describing the functional positioning of each software. The number of such tags is variable.
