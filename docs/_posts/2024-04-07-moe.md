## Introduction

GNU Moe is a text editor. It is part of the GNU Project. Like GNU Emacs or GNU Nano, it is a WYTIWYG (what you type is what you get) mode-less editor.

It is much less well-known than GNU Emacs and GNU Nano. But it still has some creativity in its design. It tries to rationalize the keyboard commands. Its editing commands are divided into move, modify, and completion. These categories correspond to Alt, Control and Tab related shortcut keys respectively. This is worth learning from for the current shortcut key layout design.

Its main limitation is that it only supports ASCII and ISO-8859. This means that it cannot properly edit text in Unicode-related encodings.
