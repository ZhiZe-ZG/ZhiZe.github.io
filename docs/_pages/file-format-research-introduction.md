File Format Research is a series of introductory articles about file formats.

## Symbols and Tags

Here are descriptions of the symbols I'll use in this series of articles:

* Openness
  * Open Source?
    * ğŸ“– Open format documentation
    * ğŸ“• Private format documentation
  * Charge?
    * ğŸ†“ Free
    * ğŸ’° Charge

I also add at least one tag describing the usage of each format. The number of such tags is variable.
