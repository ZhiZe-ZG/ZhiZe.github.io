Here is some prinples of this site:

* No comments: You are still free to critize, but not be shown here. In today's Internet environment, the opinions of comments are considered to be related to the opinions of website administrators to a certain extent. At the same time, I donâ€™t have enough energy to maintain a friendly comment area. Therefore there are no comments on this site. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ZhiZe-ZG/zhize-zg.github.io/issues) or contact me via e-mail.
* Try to be honest: I will try to ensure that the articles in the site are based on science or records, and I will try not to make up myths in the stories about myself. But I am a mortal after all, and I cannot guarantee the site absolutely the case. I think it's better to admit you can't be neutral than lying to others.
